To prevent a page from reloading when adding a file via AJAX in a Django application, start by creating an HTML form with a file input and ensure it has the `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute. Next, use JavaScript to listen for the form's submission event and prevent the default page reload by calling `event.preventDefault()`. This allows the file upload to be handled asynchronously. To do this, create a `FormData` object to gather the form's data, including the file, and send it to the server using an AJAX request, either with the `fetch()` API or jQuery's `$.ajax()` method. On the server side, the Django view handles the file via `request.FILES`, processes it, and returns a JSON response indicating the outcome. This approach enables the file upload without a full page reload, enhancing the user experience.
